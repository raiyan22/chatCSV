## Workflow

Driven by an advanced language model, the agent strategically selects tools such as calculators, web searches, IDEs, formulas, and statistics to generate actions that potentially address user queries. The project employs an iterative loop of thinking, action generation, interpretation, and comparison to ascertain if the response aligns with user questions. Once a viable solution is identified, the agent delivers it to users, enhancing problem-solving and interactive experiences.
